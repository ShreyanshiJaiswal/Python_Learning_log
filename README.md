# Python_Learning_log

## Learning Log – Python, Pandas & NumPy  

I started this on **1st August 2025** to improve my **data and analytics skills**.  
This repo is basically a log of how I’m learning step by step. I’ll **keep updating it** as I move forward into things like Matplotlib, Seaborn, maybe some ML basics later.  

Everything is done on **Google Colab**.

## Python (1st – 10th August 2025)  

For Python, I followed [CodeWithHarry’s playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agwh1XjRt242xIpHhPT2llg&si=3OwNeMYnh0QJ1avq).  
I made my own handwritten notes while watching the videos and kept looking back at them whenever I needed revision. Alongside that, I also asked ChatGPT simple beginner-level questions, copied them into Colab as comments, and then solved them step by step.

Basically → comment the question, write the code, run it, then move on to the next one in a new cell.  

I gave myself 10 days for this and split topics like this:  

- Day 1 → basics, variables, data types, typecasting  
- Day 2 → operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment)  
- Day 3 → if-else, nested if, boolean logic  
- Day 4 → loops (for, while, break, continue, pass)  
- Day 5 → functions part 1 (def, parameters, return, default values)  
- Day 6 → functions part 2 (lambda, local vs global, *args, **kwargs)  
- Day 7 → modules & libraries (math, datetime, random, os, sys)  
- Day 8 → lists & tuples  
- Day 9 → dictionaries  
- Day 10 → sets + revision

## Pandas  

For Pandas, I mostly learned from [Pandas by Ankit Bansal](https://youtu.be/sWCigkLzGdY?si=jw5ayTYo5kTHmb6Z).  
I didn’t break it down into days, just picked up concepts and coded along. Whenever something was a bit confusing, I wrote short explanations for myself in Colab text cells.  

Topics I covered:  
- basics (series, dataframe, creating dataframes)  
- exploring data (`.shape`, `.columns`, `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.loc[]`, `.iloc[]`)  
- missing data (`.dropna()`, `.fillna()`, `.astype()`)  
- duplicates & replace (`.drop_duplicates()`, `.replace()`, `.rename()`)  
- filtering & sorting (`.sort_values()`, `.sort_index()`)  
- groupby, aggregations, pivot tables  
- merging & concatenation (`concat`, `merge`, `join`)  
- apply functions (`map`, `apply`, `applymap`, string ops)  
- extra stuff like `.explode()`, `axis=1` functions  
- datetime handling, resampling, rolling

## NumPy  

For NumPy, I again followed [Numpy by Ankit Bansal](https://youtu.be/viJgXuXOaEk?si=R-bb8piA92eQZLbF).  
Same approach as Pandas → coded along and left short explanations in Colab text cells for future reference.  

Topics I covered:  
- creating arrays (`np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.arange`, `np.linspace`)  
- attributes (`shape`, `ndim`, `dtype`, `size`)  
- indexing & slicing (1D, 2D, 3D)  
- reshaping (`reshape`, `ravel`, `flatten`, `transpose`)  
- math operations, broadcasting  
- aggregates (`sum`, `mean`, `min`, `max`, `argmax`, `argmin`)  
- stacking & splitting (`vstack`, `hstack`, `split`)  
- random (`rand`, `randint`, `choice`, `seed`)  
- boolean indexing & filtering  
- linear algebra basics (dot product, inverse, determinant)  

📂 All notebooks are inside [`03-NumPy`](./03-NumPy/).

## Final note  

This repo is just my personal log. It’s not advanced work or fancy projects. It’s simply me → learning, practicing, and writing things in my own way.  

I’ll keep updating this as I continue.
